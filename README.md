##### Requirements  
* Incorporate ALL UI elements (if you see it in the reference image I should see it in your assignment)
* You must use images (repo has an assets folder with images for you to use). [Here's a video on how to add images to your project](http://codewithchris.com/11-adding-and-displaying-images-in-your-app/)

**HINT:**
Any setup code you need to write can be written in the supplied `viewDidLoad:` method in the `ViewController` class.

**Bonus**
* Hook up the segmented control to your controller. When the user selected different segments, update the label below to reflect the change  
* Have the "follow" button toggle between "follow" and "following" when tapped  
* Use a profile/cover image from the web with the NSURL class.
